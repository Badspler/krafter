# Krafter

Krafter is a tool to build seasonal yaml for the [holo](https://github.com/r-anime/holo) project, which is for creating Anime episode discussion threads on Reddit for seasonal airing shows.

Krafter works by scraping all necessary information from [livechart.me](https://www.livechart.me/).

This tool aims to complete the bulk of the work for a seasonal yaml and should be manually reviewed. 
Especially for episode names.
